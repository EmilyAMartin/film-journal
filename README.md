## Project Overview

Film Journal is a web application designed for movie lovers who want to track their film experiences, create personalized watchlists, and curate favorite films all in one place. The app focuses on simplicity, storing user data locally rather than requiring an account or online database.

The platform features several key sections:

**Journal Page:**  
Users can write reflections or reviews for films they’ve watched. Each journal entry includes details like film title, director, poster and notes.

**Watchlist Page:**  
Allows users to maintain a dynamic list of films they want to see. Users can easily add, edit, or remove films as their interests evolve.

**Favorites Page:**  
Users can mark certain films as favorites for quick access and viewing inspiration later.

## Motivation

This project was inspired by my own habit of tracking films. I wanted a lightweight, personal film journal that doesn’t depend on a sign-up system or internet connection. Just a clean, local-first experience that feels like a digital notebook for movie lovers.
