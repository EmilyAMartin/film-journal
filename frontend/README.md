## Project Overview

This application I developed allows users to easily track and journal the films they've watched, create watchlists of movies they want to see, and maintain a dedicated list of their all-time favorites. It provides a simple and organized way to keep track of both past viewing experiences and future films.

## Motivation

The inspiration for this project came from my own need for a tool to track films. Every year, I create a list of movies I want to watch and also keep track of my favorites. Previously, I used Google Docs and IMDb, but neither was quite the right fit. I wanted to build an app that would allow me to seamlessly manage watchlists, mark films I've watched, and even journal about the ones that left a lasting impression.
